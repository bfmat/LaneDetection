# LaneDetection
A lane detection system for autonomous driving in Keras, loosely based on https://github.com/brendon-ai/SelfDrivingNetwork but not end-to-end.

## Usage Notes
In order to run the executable scripts, which import other modules within the project, you may have to add the parent directory of the project to your `PYTHONPATH`.
